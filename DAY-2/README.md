# üìö Day 2: Understanding .lib Files, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis & Coding Style Optimizations #

> *‚ÄúSynthesis is not just translation ‚Äî it‚Äôs optimization guided by timing, area, and power.‚Äù*

This session dives into the foundational elements that drive synthesis decisions ‚Äî from technology libraries (`.lib`) to design hierarchy and coding practices that influence synthesis results. You‚Äôll learn how to interpret library data, control synthesis behavior, and write Verilog that synthesizes efficiently.

## üéØ Session Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand the structure and purpose of `.lib` (library) files.
- Learn how synthesis tools use `.lib` for timing and area estimation.
- Differentiate between **hierarchical** and **flat** synthesis flows.
- Identify how **coding style** affects synthesis output.
- Discover **interesting optimizations** performed automatically by synthesis tools.

## üìò Part 1: Demystifying .lib Files

### What is a .lib File?
A **Liberty (.lib)** file contains:
- Cell definitions (AND, OR, FF, etc.)
- Timing arcs (setup, hold, propagation delays)
- Power consumption data
- Area information
- Pin capacitance, drive strength, etc.

These are used by synthesis tools (like Yosys/ABC) to map RTL logic to actual standard cells from a specific technology node (e.g., SkyWater 130nm).

### Example Command:
```bash
yosys> read_liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
‚û°Ô∏è This loads the library so synthesis can perform **technology mapping** using real cell characteristics.

> üí° The `.lib` file is the bridge between abstract RTL and physical implementation.

## üß± Part 2: Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis

### Hierarchical Synthesis
- Preserves module boundaries during synthesis.
- Useful for large designs, IP reuse, and team-based development.
- Each sub-module is synthesized independently.

#### Example: `multiple_modules.v`
```verilog
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
    wire net1;
    sub_module1 u1 (.a(a), .b(b), .y(net1));
    sub_module2 u2 (.a(net1), .b(c), .y(y));
endmodule
```

‚úÖ **Output**: Synthesis generates separate netlists for `sub_module1`, `sub_module2`, and top-level.

üñºÔ∏è **Image 1**: Shows hierarchical view in `.dot` format ‚Äî `sub_module1` as a black box with internal AND gate.

### Flat Synthesis
- Merges all modules into a single flat netlist.
- Enables global optimizations across module boundaries.
- Often results in smaller area or better timing.

#### Command:
```bash
yosys> flatten
```
‚û°Ô∏è Deletes unused modules and flattens hierarchy.

üñºÔ∏è **Image 4**: After flattening, the design becomes one continuous netlist ‚Äî no module boundaries remain.

## üñ•Ô∏è Part 3: Hands-On Comparison ‚Äì Hierarchical vs Flat

### Image 2: Side-by-Side Code View
Left: Hierarchical code (`multiple_modules_hier.v`)  
Right: Flattened code (`multiple_modules_flat.v`)  
‚Üí Shows how internal wires become explicit and modules are expanded.

### Image 5: Writing Back Verilog
After synthesis, you can dump the netlist back to Verilog:
```bash
yosys> write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
```
‚û°Ô∏è Output shows mapped cells like `sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0` ‚Äî confirming technology mapping occurred.

## üõ† Part 4: Coding Styles & Their Impact on Synthesis

### How Your Code Affects Output
Synthesis tools optimize based on:
- Signal assignments
- Module instantiations
- Combinational vs sequential logic structure

#### Example: Multiplier Block
üñºÔ∏è **Image 3**: Shows a block labeled `mult8` with input `a` ‚Üí `2x 2:0 - 5:0` ‚Üí output `y`.
‚û°Ô∏è This represents an 8-bit multiplier inferred from RTL ‚Äî even if not explicitly instantiated!

> *Image 3: Synthesis inferred an 8-bit multiplier (`mult8`) from RTL description.*

> üí° Synthesis tools can infer complex functions (adders, multipliers, FSMs) from simple RTL.

---

## üåÄ Part 5: Interesting Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Constant Propagation & Dead Code Elimination
If a signal is always constant or unused, synthesis removes it.

### Optimization 2: Gate-Level Merging
Multiple small gates may be merged into a single complex gate for area/timing efficiency.

### Optimization 3: Hierarchy Flattening for Global Optimization
As shown in Image 4 ‚Äî flattening allows ABC to optimize across what were previously module boundaries.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Always load the correct `.lib` before synthesis.
- Use hierarchical design for modularity; flatten only when optimizing.
- Write clean, readable RTL ‚Äî synthesis tools reward simplicity.
- Review synthesis reports and dot graphs to understand optimizations.
